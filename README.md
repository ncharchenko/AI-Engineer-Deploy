## **Introduction**

There are various ways of deploying LLM applications depending on your needs: for pre-trained models, hosted APIs (e.g., OpenAI) offer instant setup and minimal infrastructure. If you are deploying your own fine-tuned models, you would need a GPU-powered server (either cloud-based or local) to serve your inference endpoints.

As you know, frameworks like LangChain help you orchestrate your LLM applications, and others like FastAPI let you expose clean, RESTful API endpoints. Typically, you package your code in a Docker image and use Kubernetes or a serverless platform (like AWS Lambda) to run it, enabling automatic scaling with demand. In this task, this is what you will work on.

You already have an LLM app that is prepared for production. You did monitoring, evaluation, refined your prompts, cost management, and even added guardrails. Now, you will add an API endpoint, containerize the app, and deploy it to AWS. This way, your app will be ready for everyone else to use.

## **Setup**

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python package management. Follow these steps to get started:

### Prerequisites

1. Install uv:
   ```bash
   # On macOS and Linux
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

   # On Windows
   powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
   ```

2. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   uv --version
   ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd AI-Engineer-Deploy
   ```

2. From the repository root, install the locked dependencies using `uv`:
   ```bash
   uv sync --directory starter_code --locked
   ```

   This will:
   - Create or reuse uv's managed project environment in `starter_code/.venv/`
   - Install the exact dependencies from `starter_code/uv.lock`
   - Fail instead of changing the lockfile if `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` disagree

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp starter_code/.env.sample starter_code/.env
   # Edit starter_code/.env with your API keys and configuration
   ```

### Running the Tests

Run the complete test suite from the repository root:

```bash
uv run --directory starter_code --locked python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

The `--directory starter_code` option is required because the Python project
metadata and flat application modules live under `starter_code/`. It makes both
uv project selection and the subprocess working directory explicit, so test
discovery can import those modules without manual environment activation.

Validated from a fresh shell with no activated Conda or virtual environment,
using uv's managed project environment.

As a future cleanup, an installable package or conventional `src/` layout could
simplify imports and root-level test execution. That refactor is intentionally
out of scope for this assignment and PR.

### Running the Application

```bash
uv run --directory starter_code python main.py
```

If your IDE (VS Code, PyCharm) isn't recognizing the environment or you need to use tools that aren't uv-aware, activate the virtual environment manually:
```bash
cd starter_code
source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

# Run the application
python main.py
```

### Adding New Dependencies

To add new packages to the project:

```bash
uv add --directory starter_code <package-name>
```

For development dependencies:

```bash
uv add --directory starter_code --dev <package-name>
```

### Managing Environment Variables

When adding new environment variables to your project:

1. **Always update `.env.sample`** with the new variable names (without actual values):
   ```bash
   # Example: Adding a new service
   NEW_SERVICE_API_KEY="<your-api-key-here>"
   NEW_SERVICE_BASE_URL="<service-url>"
   ```

2. **Do not remove `.env.sample`** - This file serves as a template for other developers and documents all required environment variables for the project.

3. **Add descriptive comments** in `.env.sample` to explain what each variable is used for, especially if it's not immediately obvious.

### Cloud Service Configuration

Task Two requires managed Qdrant, Redis, and Langfuse services. Provide these
settings through the application's runtime environment or secret manager:

```text
QDRANT_URL=https://<cluster-endpoint>
QDRANT_API_KEY=<qdrant-api-key>
REDIS_URL=redis://<username>:<url-encoded-password>@<public-endpoint>:<port>/0
LANGFUSE_HOST=https://cloud.langfuse.com
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=<langfuse-public-key>
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=<langfuse-secret-key>
```

Use `redis://` for a TLS-enabled Redis database. The Redis URL must select
database `0`. On its first use, the smartphone information tool creates the
`smartphones` Qdrant collection and uploads the bundled dataset; later requests
reuse that collection. `LANGFUSE_HOST` is required explicitly. The Langfuse
project must contain the `context_system_prompt` and `review_system_prompt`
prompts loaded during application startup.

### Production Container

Build the production image from the repository root. The build does not copy
`.env` files or accept secrets as build arguments:

```bash
docker build -t hypersite:latest .
```

Supply every required setting at runtime. No configuration value has an
application fallback, so the container exits during startup when a required
variable is missing or invalid:

```bash
docker run --rm --env-file starter_code/.env -p 8000:8000 hypersite:latest
```

The container continues to run as the dedicated non-root `app` user. Use
`GET /health` as its liveness probe; it returns `{"status": "ok"}` without
checking Redis, Qdrant, model providers, tracing, or other external services.

For production, inject these variables from the platform's secret manager
instead of storing an environment file on the host.

### Documenting Code Structure Changes

If you modify the default application structure or change how the application runs:

1. **Update this README** with the new run instructions in the "Running the Application" section above.

2. **Document any new directories or files** in the "Project Structure" section.

3. **Explain the reasoning** for structural changes in your Pull Request description so reviewers understand the architectural decisions.

Examples of changes that require documentation updates:
- Moving code from `main.py` into modular files under `src/`
- Introducing new entry points (e.g., `app.py`, `cli.py`)
- Adding configuration files or changing how configuration is loaded
- Creating new directories for components, utilities, or services

## **Learning Outcomes**

We cover deploying LLM applications in a production-ready environment. You'll use tools and services like FastAPI for creating REST API endpoints, Docker for containerization, SaaS providers for various services, and AWS Cloud to ship and share what you've been building.

## **Tasks**

The project is divided into various tasks that you need to complete. The tasks are located in the tasks folder of the repository. Each task includes all the necessary objectives, suggested development steps, deliverables, and useful resources. Here's a brief overview of each task:

- **Task One — API Endpoint:** Create a REST API endpoint with FastAPI that handles `POST` requests and returns a response from the LLM.
- **Task Two — Refactor to Cloud Services**: Use SaaS providers for your vector store, Redis, and Langfuse, instead of self-hosting them.
- **Task Three  — Production-ready Docker Image**: Containerize the FastAPI application using Docker to ensure it runs consistently across different environments.
- **Task Four — Deployment to AWS**: Deploy the application to AWS using AWS EC2 Instances.

This project starts from a solution stored in the `/starter_code` directory. The tasks of this project should be completed based on the provided code.
## **Useful Resources**

Each task contains a collection of resources that will be helpful for you as you solve the task. There are links to topics in Hyperskill, documentation, and other helpful tutorials that you can use. You may not always need to use all the provided resources if you're already familiar with the concepts. In addition to the provided resources, you can always discuss with your teammates and experts. You can use various channels—GitHub Issues, GitHub Discussions, PRs, or Discord.

## **Deliverables**

Each task contains a set of deliverables that bring you close to achieving the final goal. The final product is an LLM application that is accessible from anywhere, and a Docker image for your application in a public container registry of your choice (you can still delete it afterward). Add the link to the image in the About section of the repo found on the right side of the repo page.
